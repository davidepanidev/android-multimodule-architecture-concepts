_Android Multimodule Architecture Concepts_ is a project to showcase different architectural approaches 🏛 to developing multi-modular Android apps 📱.

🔎  The architecture proposed consists of 3 different layers:
* **Presentation layer**: contains all the Android UI framework components (e.g. Activities, Fragments, ViewModels...) and the related resources (e.g. images, strings...).
* **Domain layer**: contains the platform-independent business logic and models.
* **Data layer**: contains the repositories, the data sources api implementations and the corresponding api-specific models.

These layers are implemented using 3 separate modules to increase decoupling and separation of concerns. The dependencies between the modules are set so that the _data layer_ is completely invisible to the _presentation layer_ and vice versa.

## Architecture concepts 🏛

The project hosts each architecture concept in a separate branch (this _main_ branch only contains an empty template). 

🔎  The proposed concepts are: 
* [**Layered Architecture Concept**](https://github.com/davidepanidev/android-multimodule-architecture-concepts/tree/layered-architecture-concept): the dependency between the modules is <code>_presentation_ -> _domain_ -> _data_</code>. The 3 modules are Android modules. The visibility among the modules is shown by the picture below:

* [**Clean Architecture Concept**](https://github.com/davidepanidev/android-multimodule-architecture-concepts/tree/clean-architecture-concept): the dependency between the modules is <code>_presentation_ -> _domain_ <- _data_</code>. The _presentation_ and _data_ modules are Android modules whereas the _domain_ module is a Kotlin library being the innermost platform-independent module. The visibility among the modules is shown by the picture below:

* [**Clean Architecture Compose Concept**](https://github.com/davidepanidev/android-multimodule-architecture-concepts/tree/clean-architecture-compose-concept): branch of the [**Clean Architecture Concept**](https://github.com/davidepanidev/android-multimodule-architecture-concepts/tree/clean-architecture-concept) with the UI built with Jetpack Compose 🚀.

The App retrieves data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and shows the current most capitalized cryptocurrency (which of course is Bitcoin 😄).
